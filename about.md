## Who Am I?  
I started this blog when I was intern, then I got carried away with the corporate world and it's turbulences. Now I am a Senior Software Engineer, I have a family and have moved to Estonia in the EU. 

Life is beautiful and we must cherish it everyday. This blog serves to me as a part of me that was entirely and utterly curious, now after 7 years of writing code, deploying projects, and travelling around the world - I have found once again the curiosity that once invigorated me and jotted the path of my life.

The hardest question to answer now is Who Am I, as you can see the response to this was quite enthusiatic when I was younger. Who Am I? I do not know, but I'm finding out my place in this world and reigniting my innerself. 



<del>Hey **Bakar** here!  I was born and raised in Pakistan, but currently in Istanbul till 2019. I am Budding Java EE Developer as working on Software Development specifically with Spring(MVC/Security/Data) but these days I'm learning my ropes around the Enterprise *Javaverse*!
## What do I do?
<del>Currently I'm working as a Assistant Software Developer at [etcBase](https://www.etcbase.com/) in Istanbul, Turkey. I still have to complete my final year of studies as I am a Computer Science Student studying at [NUCES](http://nu.edu.pk/Home) after finishing my little one year venture in Istanbul.
## What do I like?
 <del>Recently I've started to interact with multiple Open Source Projects and I must say I love it. I'm also quite fond of travelling and doing some amateur photography on my weekend strolls or day-to-day commuting(Hoping to share some photos soon) plus I've grown quite fond of retro-technology from the 80's & 90's, those are some interesting marvels of early computer engineering!
Apart from that I consider myself a student of the stoic branch of philosophy as I read the works of Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius in order to find the meaning of our Existence or if there is any!?
